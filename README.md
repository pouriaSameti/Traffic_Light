# Traffic_Light
The Assembly Language &amp; Microprocessor Course Final Project.


## Introduction
We implemented Traffic lights on a crossroad using AVR Atmega32 Microchip. We designed the circuit of AVR with Proteus and programmed it with C Language.


## Circuit
We Have two potentiometers. The first potentiometer sets how many seconds the green & red lights are active. The second potentiometer sets the time ratio of Horizontal & Vertical Traffic lights.

## Code
By using Atmel Studio we programmed our AVR Atmega32 Microchip using C language.
